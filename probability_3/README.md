Harvard Data Science: **Probability**

3rd Course out of 9 in the Certification. 

## Description of course

Probability theory is the mathematical foundation of statistical inference 
which is indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and 
thus essential for data scientists. 

- Motivation:

The circumstances surrounding the financial crisis of 2007-2008. 
Part of what caused this financial crisis was that the risk of certain 
securities sold by financial institutions was underestimated. 
To begin to understand this very complicated event, we need to understand the basics of probability.
